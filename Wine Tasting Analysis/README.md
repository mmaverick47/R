# Wine Tasting Analysis

Data set available at: https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews

We chose a dataset of wine reviews and ratings collected and made publicly available
on Kaggle to analyze for this project. The dataset comprised two Microsoft Excel Comma
Separated Values (CSV) files that were combined for a total of over 97,000 values. 

Some categories were not included in the combined data set and / or used for analysis,
including designation of the wine (the vintage), secondary region (often blank or a duplicate
of the primary region), title of the wine, and Twitter handle of the wine taster.
There are some obvious biases to the dataset that cannot be overcome for this analysis. The
wine ratings come from a United States-based publication, so a large number of the rated
wines come from the United States, California in particular. There was no way to avoid a
significant bias towards United States and California wines without combining data from
foreign sources, which we did not have access to.
